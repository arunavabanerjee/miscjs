======================
webpack server 1.15.0

======================
webpack is a module bundler. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. The 
most pressing reason for developing another module bundler was "Code Splitting" and that static assets should fit seamlessly together 
through modularization.

Goals
Split the dependency tree into chunks loaded on demand
Keep initial loading time low
Every static asset should be able to be a module
Ability to integrate 3rd-party libraries as modules
Ability to customize nearly every part of the module bundler
Suited for big projects
